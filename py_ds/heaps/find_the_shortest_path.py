    get_shorter_paths() has three parameters:

      - tentative is a dictionary mapping a position to the shortest known path.
      - positions is an iterable of positions to which you want to shorten the path.
      - through is the position through which, perhaps, a shorter path to the positions can be found.

    You keep three pieces of data:

      - certain is the set of certain positions.
      - candidates is the heap of candidates.
      - tentative is a dictionary mapping nodes to the current shortest known path.

    A position is in certain if you can be certain that the shortest known path is the shortest possible path.
    If the destination is in the certain set, then the shortest known path to the destination is unquestionably the shortest
    possible path, and you can return this path.

    The heap of candidates is organized by the length of the shortest known path and is managed with the help of the
    functions in the Python heapq module. At each step, you look at the candidate with the shortest known path.
    This is where the heap is being popped with heappop(). There is no shorter path to this candidateâ€”all other paths go
    through some other node in candidates, and all of these are longer. Because of that, the current candidate can be
    marked certain.

    You then look at all neighbors that have not been visited, and if going through the current node is an improvement,
    then you add them to the candidates heap using heappush()
